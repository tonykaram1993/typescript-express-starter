/**
 * The authenticationMiddleware function checks for a valid authorization header, decodes the token, retrieves the user
 * associated with the token, and attaches the user object to the request before passing it to the next middleware. It
 * also checks that the user is not forced to re-login. A user is forced to re-login when they signout or change their
 * password.
 *
 * @param request - The `request` parameter represents the incoming HTTP request object, which contains information about
 * the client's request such as headers, query parameters, and request body.
 * @param response - The `response` parameter is the HTTP response object that is used to send a response back to the
 * client. It contains methods and properties that allow you to set the response status, headers, and body.
 * @param next - The `next` parameter is a function that is called to pass control to the next middleware function in the
 * chain. It is typically used to move to the next middleware function or to the route handler.
 *
 * @returns {void} In this code snippet, if the `authorizationHeader` is `undefined`, a response with status code `401`
 * (UNAUTHORIZED) and a JSON object containing a `message` property will be returned. If the `authorizationHeader` is
 * defined, the code will continue to execute and call the `next()` function to pass control to the next middleware or
 * route handler.
